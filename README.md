This repo shows how to post a request and do polling for every 10 seconds.
## Examples
- Python 
- Javascript (Node.js)

## Notice
- Polling the direct task URL does not consume RapidAPI quota
- Recommended polling interval is 5–10 seconds to avoid rate limiting
- Most image generation tasks complete within 30–90 seconds
